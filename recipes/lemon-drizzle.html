        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What can I say its a lovely lemoney cake!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>         
            
            <h3> For The cake</h3>  
            <li> 225g unsalted butter, softened </li>
            <li> 225g caster sugar </li>
            <li> 4 eggs </li>
            <li> 225g self-raising flour </li>
            <li> 1 lemon, zested </li>

            <h3> For the Drizzle Topping</h3>     
            <li> 1½ lemons, juiced </li>
            <li> 85g caster sugar </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. </li>
            <li> Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through. </li>
            <li> Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined. </li>
            <li> Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon. </li>
            <li> Bake for 45-50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. </li>
            <li> While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the lemons juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle. </li>
            <li> Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle – the juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping. </li>
            <li> Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve. Will keep in an airtight container for 3-4 days, or freeze for up to 1 month. </li>
        </ol>
